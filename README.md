# Abstract
Sportswashing is a form of propaganda used by nations, individuals, groups, corporations or government to improve negative reputations by using sports. Through hosting sporting events, acquiring sporting teams, sponsoring sporting teams or active participation in sporting events. The intention of my thesis is to better understand how sportswashing comes about. Is it easy to sportswash? Why has this become a buzzword in recent years? what sports has this issue been raised? What are the current laws concerning funding for sporting events? Is it regulated? What role do fans have in this? These are just few of the questions that I seek to answer as I research the components of this growing problem. In recent memory there have been three (3) sporting events – The 2022 World Cup, the 2022 Olympics and the new LIV Golf tournament – that have been accused as sportswashing. Using these events as a premise of my research, I hope to understand the investment by alleged parties, the validity of the outrage that was lashed out at these entities, how culpable were the governing bodies in allowing these entities to be involved in these tournaments. I will also use this to look into what these countries and corporations have been after these tournaments. Has there been a positive effect and evident change or are the concerns of fans and other entities justified? By intense research, I hope to answer or at least get more clarity on all these pieces. Combining those answers will provide a clearer perspective on the matter.
